title: "Efficient and scalable posterior surrogate for seismic inversion via wavelet score-based generative models"
---

## Abstract

Seismic inversion poses significant computational challenges due to its high dimensionality and non-unique solutions. We propose a novel method integrating the Wavelet Score-Based Generative Model (WSGM) with Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) to enable efficient posterior sampling for full-waveform inference. Our approach reduces memory requirements (≈50%) and significantly decreases sampling time (≈73%) compared to standard score-based diffusion models, while preserving accuracy.
