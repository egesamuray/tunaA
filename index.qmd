## Abstract

Seismic inversion poses significant computational challenges due to its high dimensionality and non-unique solutions. We propose a novel method integrating the Wavelet Score-Based Generative Model (WSGM) with Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) to enable efficient posterior sampling for full-waveform inference. Our approach reduces memory requirements (≈50%) and significantly decreases sampling time (≈73%) compared to standard score-based diffusion models, while preserving accuracy.

## Key Findings

- WSGM reduces memory usage by approximately 50% compared to standard score-based diffusion models
- Sampling time is reduced by about 73% while maintaining comparable accuracy (SSIM = 0.87 ± 0.03)
- Multi-scale wavelet decomposition enables hierarchical modeling from coarse to fine scales
- Uncertainty estimates correlate well with actual prediction errors
