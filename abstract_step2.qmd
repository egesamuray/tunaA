  Seismic inversion poses significant computational challenges due to its high dimensionality and non-unique solutions. We propose a novel method integrating the Wavelet Score-Based Generative Model (WSGM) with Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) to enable efficient posterior sampling for full-waveform inference. Our approach reduces memory requirements (approximately 50%) and significantly decreases sampling time (approximately 73%) compared to standard score-based diffusion models, while preserving accuracy.

# Introduction

Accurate subsurface characterization remains a fundamental challenge in geophysical exploration, with seismic inversion serving as the primary tool for reconstructing subsurface properties, such as the acoustic wave-speed. The inverse problem of estimating velocity models from seismic observations is inherently ill-posed due to its high dimensionality, non-uniqueness and sensitivity to noise [@virieux2009overview; @Tarantola2005InverseProblemTheory].
